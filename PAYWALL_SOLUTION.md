# JAMA Paywall Solution - Quick Guide

## The Problem
JAMA articles often have paywalls that block full-text access without subscription.

## Solutions (in order of preference)

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Upload PDF (RECOMMENDED)**
If you have institutional access to JAMA:
1. Go to the JAMA article
2. Click "Download PDF" 
3. In the application, select "Upload PDF" instead of "Enter URL"
4. Upload the downloaded PDF
5. ‚ú® Works perfectly every time!

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: Use Abstract-Only URL (UPDATED!)**
I just improved the scraper to accept abstract-only content:
1. Change the URL from:
   - `https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/123456`
   - To: `https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/123456`
2. The abstract has enough content for a basic presentation
3. PowerPoint will be generated with available information

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Option 3: Institutional VPN/Login**
If you have VA or university access:
1. Connect to your institution's VPN
2. Try the URL scraping again
3. The scraper will work if you're logged in

### üîß **Option 4: API Access (Future)**
We could potentially integrate with:
- PubMed API for abstracts
- CrossRef for metadata
- OpenAlex for open-access versions

## What I Just Fixed

**Updated Files:**
- `backend/speckit/pipeline/scraper.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Smarter Abstract Detection**: The scraper now recognizes abstract URLs and accepts them as valid content
2. **Better Alternative URLs**: Automatically tries the abstract-only URL if the full article fails
3. **Flexible Paywall Detection**: Abstract pages with 500+ characters are considered valid

## Try This Now

**Test with abstract URL:**
```
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/[ARTICLE_ID]
```

Replace `[ARTICLE_ID]` with the number from your original URL.

## Backend Restart Required

To apply these fixes:
```cmd
cd backend
python main.py
```

Then try scraping again!

**Best Practice**: If you regularly use this tool, ask your institution for JAMA API access or use the PDF upload feature for consistent results.
