# Backend Configuration Issue - Solution

## Problem
The backend server requires an OpenAI API key to function properly. The current `.env` file has a placeholder value which causes the AI summarization to fail.

## Solution

### Option 1: Add OpenAI API Key (Recommended)
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Edit `backend/.env` file
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key
4. Restart the backend server

### Option 2: Use Mock Data (For Testing)
The backend has been updated to use mock responses when no valid API key is provided, but you may need to set:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=mock
```

### Current Status
- ✅ Frontend ready with real backend integration
- ✅ Backend pipeline implemented with 4-step processing
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking via Server-Sent Events
- ✅ PowerPoint generation with VA styling
- ⚠️ Requires OpenAI API key for AI summarization

### Testing Without API Key
If you want to test the application without an OpenAI API key:
1. Ensure `backend/.env` has `OPENAI_API_KEY=mock`
2. The system will use predefined mock responses
3. You can still test file upload, progress tracking, and PowerPoint generation

### Next Steps
1. Configure the OpenAI API key
2. Test with a real JAMA article URL
3. Monitor the processing pipeline
4. Download the generated VA PowerPoint

The core integration is complete - you now have real backend processing instead of mock simulation!
